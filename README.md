computer vision- image classification

Questionnaire - Machine Learning Internship

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model that can classify images of industrial
equipment into two categories: 'defective' and 'non-defective'.

Tasks:
Select or create a dataset that includes images of industrial equipment labelled
as 'defective' or 'non-defective', with additional labels for the type of defect in
defective images.

Train a machine learning model to classify images into the two main categories.
Evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics such as accuracy,
precision, and recall.

Deliverables:
A Jupyter notebook or Python script with the code for data preprocessing,
model training, and evaluation.
A report summarizing the methodology, model performance, and insights
gained from the analysis.

General Evaluation Criteria for All Assignments:
Understanding of Problem Statement: Demonstrates a clear grasp of the
assignment objectives and the specific challenges that need to be addressed.
Technical Proficiency: Exhibits strong skills in programming, use of relevant
tools and frameworks, and application of appropriate algorithms or techniques.
Quality of Documentation: Provides clear, concise, and well-structured
documentation, including code comments, reports, and presentations, to
explain the methodology, results, and conclusions.
Adherence to Guidelines: Follows the provided instructions, and a deadline of 2-
3 days for the assignment, demonstrating professionalism and respect for the
evaluation process.
